## My process

- I started by creating a parent div with class name card that contained everything
- Then in the parent div, i created two divs that had column flex direction from the parent div. The top div contained the qr code and the bottom div contained the description
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

I figured out how the flexbox property works by transfering to the children of the parent


```css
body {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  height: 100vh;
  overflow: hidden;
  background-color: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
  font-family: "Outfit";
}
```
